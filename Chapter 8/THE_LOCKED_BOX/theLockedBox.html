	<p style="text-align: justify; background-color: whitesmoke">
		Consider the following (rather contrived) object.
		It is a box with a lock. There is an array in the box, but you can get at it only
		when the box is unlocked. Directly accessing the private _content property is
		forbidden.
		Write a function called withBoxUnlocked that takes a function value as ar-
		gument, unlocks the box, runs the function, and then ensures that the box
		is locked again before returning, regardless of whether the argument function
		returned normally or threw an exception.
		For extra points, make sure that if you call withBoxUnlocked when the box
		is already unlocked, the box stays unlocked.

	_content: [],
	get content() {
		if (this.locked) throw new Error("Locked!");
		return this._content;
	}
