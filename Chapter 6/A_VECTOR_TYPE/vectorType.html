<h2>A Vector Type</h2>	
<p>Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It
takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties
of the same name.
Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take an-
other vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or
difference of the two vectors' (this and the parameter) x and y values.
Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the
length of the vectorâ€”that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the
origin (0, 0).</p>
