        An object's hasOwnProperty can be used as a more robust alternative to
        the in operator when you want to ignore the prototype's properties. But
        what if your map needs to include the word "hasOwnProperty"? You won't
        be able to call that method anymore because the object's own property
        hides the method value. Can you think of a way to call hasOwnProperty on
        an object that has its own property by that name?
