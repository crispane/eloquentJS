    <title>Dominant Writing Direction</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>
      Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string
      of text. Remember that each script object has a direction prop- erty that
      can be "ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or "ttb" (top to
      bottom). The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the
      char- acters that have a script associated with them. The characterScript
      and countBy functions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful
      here.
