        Tabbed panels are widely used in user interfaces. They allow you to
        select an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs “sticking
        out” above an element. In this exercise you must implement a simple
        tabbed interface. Write a func- tion, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and
        creates a tabbed interface showing the child elements of that node. It
        should insert a list of &lt;button&gt; elements at the top of the node,
        one for each child element, containing text retrieved from the
        data-tabname attribute of the child. All but one of the original
        children should be hidden (given a display style of none). The currently
        visible node can be selected by clicking the buttons. When that works,
        extend it to style the button for the currently selected tab differently
        so that it is obvious which tab is selected.
