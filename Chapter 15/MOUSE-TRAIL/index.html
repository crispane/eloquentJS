      <h2>Eloquent JS / Exercises / Ch 15 / Mouse Trail</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; background-color: whitesmoke">
        In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages
        with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring
        ways to use the language. One of these was the mouse trail—a series of
        elements that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the
        page. In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use
        absolutely positioned &lt;div&gt; elements with a fixed size and
        background color (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an
        example). Create a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves,
        display them in the wake of the mouse pointer. There are various
        possible approaches here. You can make your solution as simple or as
        complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep a fixed
        number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one to
        the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.
