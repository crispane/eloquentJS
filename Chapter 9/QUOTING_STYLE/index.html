        Imagine you have written a story and used single quotation marks
        throughout to mark pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace all the
        dialogue quotes with double quotes, while keeping the single quotes used
        in contractions like arenâ€™t. Think of a pattern that distinguishes these
        two kinds of quote usage and craft a call to the replace method that
        does the proper replacement.
