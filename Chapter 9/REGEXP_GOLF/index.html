          Code golf is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular program
        in as few characters as possible. Similarly, regexp golf is the practice of writing
        as tiny a regular expression as possible to match a given pattern, and only that
        pattern.

      <p style="text-align: justify; background-color: whitesmoke">
          For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether any
        of the given substrings occur in a string. The regular expression should match
        only strings containing one of the substrings described. Do not worry about
        word boundaries unless explicitly mentioned. When your expression works, see
        whether you can make it any smaller.
