	<h2>Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. 
	Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend, 
	which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, 
	and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element  at the given position in the list 
	(with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.</h2>
